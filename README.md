# Convert SVG Icons to JSON
I wanted a tool that makes it braindead easy to not only export a massive icon set from Figma, but I also want the icons to be a great developer experience. 

Currently, this is just a CLI tool that loops over a directory, grabs the <kbd>path</kbd> data from the SVG's inside, and exports the path data to a new JSON file of your choosing.
